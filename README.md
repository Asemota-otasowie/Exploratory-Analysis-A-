# Exploratory-Analysis-A-
This is a project simulation by Quantium company to determine keys insights of a particular product in a supermarket. Asking relevant question of who buys what?, what segment do they belong?, what influences their preference and so on. This project is sectioned into three parts and would be uploaded subsequently when analysis has been completed.

## Project Overview
### Potato Chips Market Analysis(Retail Strategy and Analytics) 
This is a retail strategy and analytics project to determine the most sold brand of a product and how this informantion can help the client position her business stragtegically to increase sales and create a health client-customer relationship. This analysis is precise, detailed and relevant to the client's needs. 

## Objective
- Acquire and clean a real-world dataset
- Handle missing values and inconsistent data types
- perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) to uncover patterns
- Determine most bought product based on customer preference (using affinity analysis)

### Data Sources
The data source for this analysis was from [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/quantium/data-analytics-rqkb/data-preparation-and-customer-analyti), containing information on the supermarket products. However , the raw data was messy, requiring extensive cleaning and preprocessing

### Tools
This project was implemented using python with the following libraries:
- Pandas - Data Cleaning and manipulation
  
- Numpy - Data Analysis and numerical computations
  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization
  

### Key findings
- From the affinity analysis carried out it was discovered that a particular segment due to personal preference and taste in product.
- A distinct customer who buys products in bulk and how the company can help such client in the future.
- Identified segments that contributed most to sales of potato chips
- A t-test statictics showed how high/low price difference is between diffrent segments.

### Challenges & Solutions
- Messy Data: The dataset had a lot of inconsistencies, missing values, and required multiple data type conversion (dtype---astype)
  - Solution: Applied rigorous data cleaning, including filling missing values, handling incorrect data types and ensuring proper formatting
    
- Filtering: The various products had a lot of close relationships to each other and required distinct values of potato chips which required more rigourious filtering methods.
  - Solution: Explored all filtering options available until desired result was gotten.


### Next Step
Exploratory analysis-B- to further determine explore the market based on the client's needs.
